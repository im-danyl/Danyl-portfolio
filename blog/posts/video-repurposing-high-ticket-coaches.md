# How High-Ticket Coaches Turn One Video into 10 Marketing Assets

As a high-ticket coach, your time is valuable. That's why the most successful coaches have mastered the art of content repurposing—creating one piece of content and strategically transforming it into multiple marketing assets that work across different platforms and audiences.

Here's the exact system that top coaches use to multiply their content reach and attract premium clients consistently.

## The Master Content Strategy: One Video, Multiple Touchpoints

**The Foundation:** One 15-minute talking head video addressing a core problem your ideal clients face.

**The Output:** 10+ pieces of content that work for weeks across your marketing channels.

This isn't just about cutting up your video—it's about strategically creating content that serves different purposes in your marketing funnel.

## The 10-Asset Repurposing System

### 1. The Main YouTube Video (15 minutes)
Your foundation content. This should dive deep into a problem your ideal clients face and provide actionable solutions that demonstrate your expertise.

### 2-4. Three LinkedIn Articles (800-1200 words each)
Extract three key points from your video and expand each into a detailed LinkedIn article. Each article should:
* Address one specific aspect of the problem
* Include personal stories or client examples
* End with a soft call-to-action to your consultation

### 5-8. Four Instagram/LinkedIn Carousels (8-10 slides each)
Turn your main points into visual carousels:
* **Carousel 1:** "5 Signs You Need [Your Solution]"
* **Carousel 2:** "Step-by-Step: How to [Solve Problem]"
* **Carousel 3:** "Common Mistakes [Your Audience] Makes"
* **Carousel 4:** "Before vs. After: Client Transformation"
